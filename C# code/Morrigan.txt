Newgrange Built 5200 years ago, and during the Neolithic period 
(tail end of the Stone Age) This earthen temple is 600 years older 
than Egypt’s Giza Pyramids and 1000 years older than Stonehenge.


Anu or Ana (sometimes given as Anann or Anand) is the name of a goddess mentioned briefly in Irish mythology. 
The 9th century Sanas Cormaic (Cormac's Glossary) says in its entry for her: 
"Ana - mother of the gods of Ireland; well did she feed the gods". 
She may be a goddess in her own right, or another name for Danu.

The Morrigan is one of the many prominent figures to feature in Irish mythology and is primarily associated with 
war/battle, fate and death. She is a gifted shape shifter and is known to favour changing into the crow. 
The Morrigan was one of the Tuatha De Danann, who were the folk of the Goddess Danu.

Danu, also spelled Anu, or Dana, in Celtic religion, the earth-mother goddess or female principle, 
who was honoured under various names from eastern Europe to Ireland.

Danu is an ancient Scythian word meaning "river".

Who Built Newgrange?
Gaelic mythology tells us that the original Irish race (the “Milesians”) traveled to Ireland from Hispania. 
Hispania included Andorra, Portugal and Spain, and the British Crown colony of Gibraltar.
 When they arrived, they set their sites on defeating the powerful Tuatha Dé Danann. 

In the final throws of battle, the two warring parties agreed to divide Ireland between them. 
The Milesians took the physical world atop the earth’s crust, and the Tuatha Dé Danann were awarded the worlds and realms below, 
also known as, “The Underworld.” As time unfolded, the Tuath Dé became the worshiped, pagan gods of Ireland, still adored today. 

Legend has it that Lugh (the most powerful of gods)and his mystical family are buried at Newgrange. 
Dagda Mór and his three sons are also believed to be entombed at this holy temple.
